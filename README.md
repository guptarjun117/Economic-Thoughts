**1 - Economics of the $2 bill during CNY ~ Feb 2022**

**Question:**
According to Chinese tradition, the red packet stands for the blessings that elders wish for their younger family members. Blessings and new things are associated with Chinese culture, indicating that new and crisp bills should be used when giving red packets. This leads to banks printing large amounts of new $2 notes each year during the festive season. However, despite this, I often hear adult family members complaining about the long queues at banks to collect the new notes and the inability to obtain the total amount of notes they might require. Discuss the economic reasons for this annual phenomenon. 


**Answer:**
In reality, a classic example of a shortage can be seen outside banks before the CNY period, when old $2 notes must be exchanged for new ones. Furthermore, the fact that each individual is limited to exchanging a certain number of new notes highlights rationing, another sign of a shortage. In utilizing the economic model to analyze this shortage, we can also observe that in this instance, the $2 bill is also perceived not only as currency but also as a good that has a certain supply and demand, as well as other factors that will determine the final price and quantity. 

During the CNY season, demand for new, crisp $2 bills results from the traditional belief of the need for new notes. As a result of this surge in demand, a shortage now occurs as the quantity supplied by the central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is less than the quantity demanded by Singaporeans. This shortage manifests in the above-mentioned situations of long queues and reservations at participating bank outlets. In response to this surge in demand, MAS prints approximately 100 million new $2 notes for exchange with old notes. 

However, the money supply needs to be kept constant and new notes cannot be printed due to the fear of inflation. There cannot be an increase in the overall supply of $2 notes in response to the increase in demand caused by CNY traditions. As such, a quantity of $2 notes equivalent to that which is printed needs to be destroyed in response. But it is costly to print and subsequently destroy these old notes. This process is also unsustainable and considered detrimental to the environment, creating a negative externality. As such, this limits the number of new notes that MAS can print; hence shortage thus cannot be resolved by just printing new notes.  

As Chinese tradition mandates new $2 notes, hence one would think they are price inelastic. However, many substitutes such as the old $2 notes, coins and other note denominations make them highly price elastic. In the case of a good with a price elastic demand, a shortage may be resolved through a price increase in theory. Since the new $2 notes are price elastic, this suggests that a slight increase in price would lead to a more than proportionate decrease in demand. Therefore, in theory, this should decrease the quantity demanded by the new $2 notes. In practical terms, this can be done by banks charging a small premium when buyers come to ‘buy’/exchange for the new $2 notes.

Conversely, from the perspective of consumers/buyers, the $2 note is viewed as money used to make purchases rather than a good of its own. The association of price with the $2 note is much stronger than the association of it as a good. However, this is not always the case. Looking at examples of vintage notes or limited-edition notes, buyers are willing to pay above their monetary value to purchase the notes due to their added value as a collectible. These notes would also not conventionally be used for purchases in the market, although they are still legal tender. But newly printed $2 notes do not have this additional value of being collectibles that a hobbyist might demand and thus cannot be sold at prices above their monetary value. As a result, people are unwilling to pay for a new, crisp $2 note if its price does not match its economic value of $2. Hence, an increase in the price of $2 notes would result in severe backlash from the public, illustrating their resistance to a price change. As a result, this prevents banks from charging a slight premium for the exchange of $2 notes to increase prices and reduce demand to eliminate the shortage. 

As a result, resolving the shortage by increasing prices to reduce demand is impossible. Hence, the alternative is to make changes that might cause a shift in supply to determine the shortage. There is thus only one viable solution: MAS has to increase the supply of new $2 notes, and in turn, they must destroy the old $2 notes to prevent excess money supply from potentially leading to inflation. 

But, as was mentioned above, the destruction and printing of large quantities of new notes each year are exceptionally costly and unsustainable in the long run. To reduce the long queues at the banks and the possible damage to the environment due to the burning of the notes in the long term, the MAS has begun encouraging citizens to adapt to e-ang paos. This alternative to ang paos eliminates the need for physical $2 notes since payment will now be made electronically, reducing the quantity demanded of physical notes. Thus, a significant amount of shortage will be reduced. 

What is worth considering, however, is that a part of the population - the older generations - may be less familiar with these electronic payment methods and thus would still need to use physical ang paos. Sticking to their beliefs of using the new notes and the physical ang paos the new initiatives only reduces their demand by a smaller percentage than expected, as only the younger generation may be adaptive to this new change. As such, the shortage cannot be eliminated entirely without other policies to ensure these groups in society are enabled to change as well.

**2 - Economics of Wind Fall Taxes during COVID-19 ~ Mar 2022**

**Question:**
In early 2022, oil and gas companies experienced increased profits due to the fluctuations in oil prices. This was due to the developments of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, while soaring commodity prices meant increased profits for firms, they also led to rising household energy bills. As a result, many felt this was unfair and called on their governments to impose a windfall profits tax on these oil and gas companies. 

A windfall profit refers to an unexpected increase in profits due to uncontrollable and unpredictable external circumstances. When the government levies a windfall profits tax, this refers to a one-time tax of a fixed amount imposed retrospectively to the firm’s profit increase. 

Windfall taxes are not commonly imposed. They usually involve much careful deliberation from the government about the circumstances of the tax decision. It can be highly controversial and is often imposed on oil and gas companies rather than other industries. 

For example, working from home became the new norm throughout the pandemic due to workplace and school regulations changes. Large technology firms like Microsoft and Google reported significant profit increases because of the COVID-19 Pandemic. However, these firms did not see windfall taxes levied on their profits. 

Based on the above information and the understanding of taxes,
* Evaluate the effects of a windfall tax on the various stakeholders in the market for oil and gas (consumers, firm and their shareholders, government); and 
* Explain why a windfall tax can be levied on oil and gas companies but not on big technology companies based on the above scenarios. 

**Answer:**
Windfall taxes are one-time taxes of a fixed amount imposed on a company by the government. The extraction of finite natural resources such as oil and gas often generate excess profits when prices of these commodities spike during uncertain times, such as the pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Profits earned from this are thus considered windfall profits as circumstances outside the firms’ control generated them. As a result, the windfall profits are taxed by the government. 

Furthermore, they are levied on the company retrospectively after profits. The uncontrollable circumstances make it difficult for a firm to predict when windfall profits may be made, and thus the windfall profits tax is not predictable by firms. This means that it should not affect future investments and production processes. Since it is a fixed cost, windfall taxes levied do not affect the price-quantity decision-making process. Firms would not have a direct cause to increase the prices of the goods in the future since it is not a variable cost. Therefore, the tax burden would not fall on consumers but on stakeholders. 

Since windfall taxes are retrospective and one-time, the government can be confident that companies can pay the tax amount imposed. It also guarantees a fixed amount that is not dependent on the quantity sold or the company’s profits, thus eliminating uncertainty and creating a secure manner of generating the desired revenue for the government.  

Despite the above, windfall taxes can be controversial when imposed. Since firms cannot control the circumstances that led to the fluctuating prices creating the excess profits, they cannot control the profits that they earn and thus do not have any other options than to accept and pay the taxes. As a result, this would feel unfair to firms that can only look to lobbying as a chance to reverse the taxes, which may not always work. Another possible effect of windfall taxes is that they deter investments from shareholders toward specific industries that are more prone to incur windfall profit taxes. However, this is likely minimal since windfall profits theoretically occur in very few situations. 

This is because significant profits increase from uncontrollable, external circumstances rarely happen. While big tech companies saw significant increases in profits, this was not directly due to the unexpected external circumstances of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Because of the increased need for telecommuting due to the pandemic, consumers’ tastes and preferences changed, increasing demand for products like laptops and services like cloud computing. In response to this change in demand, tech companies increased their production capacities and improved their products to ensure they remained relevant and competitive. Thus, their profit increase came about due to internal circumstances that led to greater quantity sold or higher prices due to better product quality and are not considered windfall profits. Imposing a windfall tax, in this case, would thus suggest that these firms were being ‘punished’ for their increased revenues earned through greater productivity and improved quality. 

On the other hand, for oil and gas companies, the increase in their profits resulted directly from the increase in commodity prices for oil instead of any changes in their internal economic processes or production methods. As such, the direct circumstances leading to the increase in profits were primarily external and out of the firm's control. Thus, windfall taxes should not affect future investment or production processes since the circumstances are uncontrollable and unpredictable for the firm. Therefore, windfall profit taxes are justified for oil and gas companies that experience increased profits due to increased prices due to commodity price volatility. Still, it is not warranted for tech companies since they increase their profits due to increased production in response to changes in demand. 

In conclusion, windfall taxes are beneficial since they guarantee the government a fixed revenue while not affecting economic processes and consumers. However, they are challenging to implement due to the rare circumstances surrounding windfall profits. The more control the company has over the circumstances leading to the increase in profits, the less desirable a windfall tax is, and the greater the possibility that it would affect the decision-making process, leading to higher prices, lower quantities, or the deterrence of future investment. Hence, careful consideration must be taken when imposing windfall taxes to minimize the negative impacts.
